API Design (Next.js API Routes and MongoDB)
Here's a RESTful API setup that aligns with your project requirements. Each endpoint serves a specific function, including managing clients, handling sessions, and authenticating users.

1. Authentication Endpoints
These routes are for login, registration, and session handling.

POST /api/auth/register
Registers a new therapist account.

Body:
json
Copy code
{
  "email": "therapist@example.com",
  "password": "securePassword123",
  "name": "Therapist Name"
}
Response: Returns success or error message.
POST /api/auth/login
Logs in a user and initiates a session.

Body:
json
Copy code
{
  "email": "therapist@example.com",
  "password": "securePassword123"
}
Response: Access token or error message.
2. Client Endpoints
These routes handle client information and enable the creation and retrieval of client profiles.

POST /api/clients
Creates a new client profile.

Body:
json
Copy code
{
  "name": "Alex Smith",
  "dateOfBirth": "1993-05-10",
  "gender": "Male",
  "referralSource": "Primary Care Physician"
}
Response: Client ID and confirmation message.
GET /api/clients
Retrieves a list of clients, optionally filtered by therapist ID.

Response:
json
Copy code
[
  {
    "id": "client123",

  "gender": "Male",
  "referralSource": "Primary Care Physician",
  "sessions": [
    { "sessionId": "session1", "date": "2023-11-02T10:00:00Z" },
    ...
  ]
}
3. Session Endpoints
These routes handle session notes (DAP entries) for each client.

POST /api/sessions
Creates a new session note for a client.

Body:
json
Copy code
{
  "clientId": "client123",
  "date": "2023-11-02T10:00:00Z",
  "data": {
    "presentingProblem": "Persistent anxiety...",
    "mentalStatus": "Calm but anxious...",
    "appearance": "Slightly disheveled...",
    "interventions": "Grounding exercises",
    "response": "Receptive",
    "screenerResults": "Moderate anxiety"
  },
  "assessment": {
    "diagnosis": "Social Anxiety",
    "selfHarmRisk": "Low",
    "progress": "Awareness of triggers",
    "goalChanges": "None"
  },
  "plan": {
    "homework": "Daily journaling",
    "referrals": null,
    "takeaways": "Anxiety awareness",
    "nextSession": "2023-11-09T10:00:00Z"
  }
}
Response: Session ID and confirmation message.
GET /api/sessions/[sessionId]
Retrieves a specific session note.

Response:
json
Copy code

    "summary": "Awareness of anxiety triggers..."
  },
  ...
]
4. Report Generation Endpoint
GET /api/clients/[clientId]/report
Generates a PDF report of all sessions for a specific client.

Response: PDF file containing a structured summary of all sessions.
MongoDB Schema Design
For MongoDB, you’ll need collections for Users (therapists), Clients, and Sessions.

User Collection

json
Copy code
{
  "_id": "user123",
  "email": "therapist@example.com",
  "passwordHash": "hashed_password",
  "name": "Therapist Name",
  "createdAt": "2023-01-10T12:00:00Z"
}
Client Collection

json
Copy code
{
  "_id": "client123",
  "name": "Alex Smith",
  "dateOfBirth": "1993-05-10",
  "gender": "Male",
  "referralSource": "Primary Care Physician",
  "therapistId": "user123",
  "createdAt": "2023-01-12T14:00:00Z"
}
Session Collection

json
Copy code
{
  "_id": "session1",
  "clientId": "client123",
  "date": "2023-11-02T10:00:00Z",
  "data": { ... },
  "assessment": { ... },
  "plan": { ... },
  "createdAt": "2023-11-02T10:50:00Z"
}
This setup will enable a comprehensive and secure DAP notes application where therapists can manage client progress efficiently. Let me know if you’d like more details on specific parts, such as code snippets or database indexing strategies.
